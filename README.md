# hello-world-take-two
My name is Amy and I am training to be a Software Engineer. I hope to help the world, people and animals in need with my future coding skills. I would like to work for NASA, PIXAR, or RuPaul's Drag Race. I would like to move to Chicago because I would like to live in a major city again and I'm tired of Philly. I want to start again.
